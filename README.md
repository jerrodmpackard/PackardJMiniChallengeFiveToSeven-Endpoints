Mini Challenge Five to Seven - Endpoints
Created a web api with four endpoints; one that outputs a mad libs story based upon user inputs, one that tells the user if their input is an odd or even number, one that reverses a string of integers, and another that reverses a string of alphanumeric characters.
Peer review: Alexander Soria
Peer review comments: The programs all work, being able to produce an error if a string is inputted when an integer is needed. It's very nice that all the services and classes are in their own separate folders for each Service. Overall, a very good execution of the program.

Psuedo Code:
MadLib:
    We will need to accept user input for 10 inputs and save those to variables
    We will need to output those inputs as variables into our story

OddOrEven:
    We will need to accept user input for a number
    We will need data validation to ensure the user has entered a number
    We will need to perform the modulo operation to check if the user input is odd or even
    We will need to output the result to the user

ReverseIt (Alphanumeric)
    We will need to accept user input for a string of alphanumeric characters
    We will need to reverse the string
    We will need to output a string "You entered ABC123. Reversed is 321CBA."

ReverseIt (Integers Only)
    We will need to accept user input for a string of integers
    We will need to reverse the string of integers
    We will need to output a string "You entered 12345. Reversed is 54321."
